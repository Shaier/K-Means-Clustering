# K Means Clustering

## This repo contains several K-Means projects:
* [Food and Agriculture Organization](Food_and_Agriculture_Organization.ipynb)- comparing between food and feed consumption and trying to see what are the fastest growing countries in terms of food production\consumption.  
Food - refers to the total amount of the food item available as human food during the reference period.  
Feed - refers to the quantity of the food item available for feeding to the livestock and poultry during the reference period.  
* [K-Means Clustering and PCA-Human Activity Recognition](K-Means-Clustering-and-PCA-Human-Activity-Recognition-Dataset.ipynb)- Comparing K means clustering before and after PCA.
* [K Means Clustering Explanation+Example Using Scikit Learn](K-Means_Clustering_Explanation+Example_Using_Scikit-Learn.ipynb)- showing how K means works with a simple array of numbers.
